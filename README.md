# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello world! Well, this is interesting...
I can totally see why people use this, and am suddenly frustrated
that I did not make an attempt to use it earlier in my carrer
as a young, budding programmer. Probably would have streamlined the process
a bit... Welp.
